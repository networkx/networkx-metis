* src/GKlib/sort.c

  file:  sort.c
  brief: This file contains GKlib's various sorting routines

  These routines are implemented using the GKSORT macro that is defined
  in gk_qsort.h and is based on GNU's GLIBC qsort() implementation.

  Additional sorting routines can be created using the same way that
  these routines where defined.
